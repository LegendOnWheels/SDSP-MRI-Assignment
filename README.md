# SDSP-MRI-Assignment

This repository includes all our MATLAB code for the MRI assignment,
as part of the course EE4C03 Statistical DSP. 

The 'outlier_restoration' folder includes the code for all
5 restoration methods that we implemented:  

a_interpolator = Linear interpolation  
b_gaussian = Gaussian smoothing  
c_sg = Savitzky-Golay smoothing  
d_compressed = Compressed sensing-based inpainting  
e_rpca = Robust PCA  

The 'wiener_filter' folder contains the code for the Wiener filter.
